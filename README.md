bootstrap_slide_down_alert_-sticky-
===================================

A bootstrap alert that will slide down over content, to the current location within the viewport.

Needs to be broken into seperate files for style, JS and HTML.
Should also probably include the assumed assets (jQuery and Bootstrap)
